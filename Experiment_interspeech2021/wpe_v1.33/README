The tools and program included in this package are designed and distributed for 
the evaluation of the weighted prediction error (WPE) based dereverberation algorithm. 
This program can be used only for evaluation purpose. Please refer to the license file for details. 

Please cite the following paper when you publish results obtained using this tool.

Before starting, please read carefully the license file and the following,
   - The package includes a MATLAB pcode version of the WPE algorithm (wpe.p). 
   - wpe.p can only be used with MATLAB and cannot be compiled. 
   - To run wpe.p on MATLAB you need the signal processing toolbox.
   - The current version of wpe.p will expire within a year. 
   - Contact us to obtain a renewed version of the code if you wish 
     to continue evaluation of WPE after expiration.
   - Note that NTT may stop releasing this code at any time without prior notice.


In this package you will find the following
   (1) The license file (license.txt)
   (2) A MATLAB pcode version of the WPE algorithm (wpe.p and wpe_wavio.p)
       wpe.p inputs and outputs MATLAB matrices.
       wpe_wavio.p inputs and outputs wav files.
   (3) A sample script describing how to use wpe.p (wpe_test.m and wpe_test_wavio.m)
   (4) Setting files including 
       - settings/local.m which is a configuration file for wpe.p
       - settings/sample.scp which is an sample task file for use in wpe_test.m
       - settings/arrayname.lst which includes the naming convention for reading 
         multi-microphone data in wpe_test.m
   (5) Sample data in wav_sample/sample_ch1.wav ~ wav_sample/sample_ch8.wav
